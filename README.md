CTG Whitepaper V1.0
===================

Abstract
--------
The appearance of blockchain technology is an outstanding innovation, which can bring
great convenience to the cross-border currency exchange in particular. However, based
on the first generation of blockchain technology, the transaction confirmation speed of
Bitcoin (BTC) usually requires more than 10 minutes, and even dozens of minutes, which
is indeed too slow. Ethereum (ETH) is called the second generation of blockchain
technology and its added smart contract can make all kinds of applications expanded
freely in the network of blockchain. Nevertheless, the consensus algorithm of ETH
applies the POW mechanism of BTC which can optimize the transaction confirmation
speed. But it is still difficult to be put into practice.

As the renovation of the third generation of blockchain technology, EOS can shorten the
transaction confirmation speed to a second level, and even a millisecond level, which
makes cross-border payment and daily transaction easily come true. The new mechanism
of smart contract has solved the problem of network congestion of applications in ETH.
CTG’s first global ecological application platform with public chains in tourism based on
the latest blockchain technology applies the renovation of the third generation of
blockchain technology as the basic structure. Our platform can be practically applied in
multiple currencies exchange of cross-border tourism industries and relevant daily
payment. The issue of multiple currencies exchange will be first settled. Then the
corresponding modifications will be done aimed at upstream and downstream industries
of tourism. For example, expansion of super nodes together with concurrency of
distributed nodes, increase of the application bandwidth based on tokens, introduction
of the authentication system for multiple identities, etc. We will also make various DAPP
application templates for upstream and downstream industries of tourism so as to
provide convenience to the quick application of any third-party merchant so that the
secondary development is not needed. Our system will become the platform of tourism
industry chain in a specific field, which can make all kinds of applications of third-party
merchants rapidly entered as well as introduce room booking, flight reservation,
transportation, travel agency and tourist guide locking, operation of scenic spots,
management of restaurant chains, food, groceries, television, transmission of media, and
other tourism-related industries.

1.Background
---------------
Decentralization of blockchain technology was once a hot topic in the world. As a result, all kinds of applications in various industries are full of limitless imagination and inexplicable longing. However, it is difficult for current BTC network and ETH network to support so many applications. That nearly 30,000 ETH transactions are caused by CryptoKitties can lead to a huge congestion in ETH network and a SNT crowd-funding may directly paralyze ETH network. The issues of ETH criticized by people also include: social inequality aggravated by POS consensus mechanism; slow transfer speed; high service fee. All of these can show that ETH’s scalability and efficiency are still far away from the large-scale commercial application of blockchain. The bottleneck encountered in the development of blockchain requires a more stable and powerful system.

From January to April, 2017, the amount of overseas shopping consumption of Chinese tourists was RMB 27.79 billion and China has become the world’s largest country of outbound travel consumption in the last five consecutive years. The market share of outbound travel consumption of Chinese citizens is quite large and the global tourism economy will grow rapidly. After Chinese tourists enjoy a shopping spree in foreign countries, they will find their credit card bills are beyond their common sense. A bill of USD 570 will charge the service fee of USD 50. The source of the increased cost is truly an unclear accounting for most consumers. Reporters find that the accounting includes not only the two-time currency exchange fee that most consumers have no idea and the international transaction fee which is 1%~1.5% of the total amount that the issuing bank shall pay to VISA, Mastercard or other international card organizations, but also the service fee charged by some banks without any notice.

Our priority is to use the latest blockchain technology to solve the problem of multiple currencies exchange in tourism payment. Then we will make a DAPP that can be applied by any third-party merchant based on the upstream and downstream industry chain of tourism. We wish to combine technology with application to promote the development of tourism.


2.Basic Requirements for Technology of Tourism Industry Chain
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Blockchain of BTC is the data block produced according to the order and its scale is growing exponentially. However, the surge of everyday transactions, the increase of transaction confirmation time, the resource consumption of the consensus mechanism based on Proof of Work (PoW) as well as the stronger control of the whole BTC network by mining rigs and mining pools have caused unsteadiness and doubt of the application scalability in decentralized BTC.

The smart contract of ETH network has brought a glimmer of hope to applications. However, due to its own storage ability and operation mechanism, it is hard to run the large DAPP.

In order to acquire wide recognition and application, an innovative system based on the brand-new conceptive architecture must be developed and we think some basic requirements shall be met.

### 2.1 Support Millions of Users
In 2017, the network transaction amount of China UnionPay was RMB 93,900 billion and the daily number of network transaction of China UnionPay was over 10 million. If a blockchain application is expected to support millions of users just as the business of eBay, Uber, AirBnB, and Facebook, its blockchain technology applied shall be capable of handling tens of millions of active daily users. In certain case, an application may not work unless a critical mass of users is reached and therefore a platform that can handle large numbers of users is paramount.

### 2.2 Transaction Confirmation Speed
A good user experience demands a reliable feedback which costs no more than a few seconds. Currently, the transaction confirmation speed in BTC network costs over 10 minutes and even more time, which cannot meet the payment requirements of application level at all. Such long delay and wait seriously affect the user experience as well as make the application constructed on the blockchain unmatched with current products without blockchain technology. Therefore, the platform shall be able to support the second level and even the millisecond level transaction confirmation speed, which is the basic and key technique requirement of application payment.

### 2.3 Performance
Performance is the core element supporting the two vital issues above (millions of users and fast transaction confirmation speed).
The more the users make transactions in BTC or ETH, the more crowded the network will be. The slow speed is determined by the algorithm mechanism. The PoW applied by BTC stands for Proof of Work. Each transaction requires everybody to participate in the calculation and then the node that calculates fastest will keep accounts, which may greatly increase the workload but sacrifice the efficiency. The number of transfer of BTC is around 7 per second while the number of transfer of ETH is advanced to 15 per second. Compared to the traditional transaction mode, the number of transfer of Visa is 1,667 per second while the number of transfer of Paypal is 193 per second. We can see that the gap among them is still rather big.
What EOS applies is the DPOS Consensus Algorithm which can reach 10,000~100,000 per second in the harsh testing condition. In addition, EOS will apply the parallel processing technology which can make the transaction scale reached up to millions per second. If this standard is achieved, EOS may simultaneously support thousands of DAPPs on its platform.
There are different kinds of consensus algorithms at present and the DPOS that EOS applies will be our priority.

### 2.4 Security
In aspects of finance and payment, security always comes first.
The traditional payment system takes bank as media and national credit as guarantee, which is safe under certain conditions. However, business factors and human factors are inevitable. Human factors may cause a possibility of making mistakes and the wrong decision may affect the safety of the currency financial system.
BTC is forking again and again while ETH is divided into ETH and ETC, which are caused by the design of architecture so that the consensus cannot be reached. The forking of BTC is due to expansion and network congestion while the division of ETH is due to DAO. However, these factors are just the superficial fuse. In essence, it is because the design of underlying architecture has its own defects and the consensus mechanism fails to reach a consistent and effective solution. The third-party proposal was once attempted to make up the defects of the ETH architecture but the operating system was set. The only way of mending was to put a patch, which could not change from the underlying architecture. 
The solution of EOS comes from two aspects: one is the consensus and the other is the design of underlying architecture.
The delegation authorization mechanism of DPOS can be understood by the parliamentary system. The representatives can be assigned to exercise voting rights, which is the source for the competition of 21 super nodes. Among over 100 backup nodes of EOS, only 21 super nodes can be selected to exercise voting rights. When it comes to differences and problems, voting is the most effective way of treatment so as to avoid the appearance of hard-fork. Even if hard-fork appears in the design of underlying architecture, it can be treated by freezing.
In terms of underlying architecture, the problems arising from the application of public chains for all the developers of EOS blockchain can be solved by means of offering feedback to the community for remediation as well as modifying the underlying architecture according to its own demands. With this set of mechanism, it will be easy to add the effective new technology into EOS, which can accelerate the speed of modification and iteration of underlying architecture. Therefore, from this respect, EOS is relatively stable and secure. EOS also has the advantage of iteration and its scalability has been greatly improved.

### 2.5 Application Presetting
We know that the design of BTC limits its own development of new functions and applications. The network congestion of ETH can only be mended and improved by means of putting a third-party patch due to the defects of underlying architecture, however, the expansion and revolution cannot be performed in the underlying architecture.
Based on the solution of ETH, we have designed the cross-chain interaction and the independent architecture mechanism on the virtual machine, which can offer a more flexible proposal to the development of DAPP. With minor modifications, the contract of ETH is able to run on the platform.
Nevertheless, most merchants have no idea about the relevant technique concept so they don’t know how to start. That’s why we select the best platform for application presetting. We will focus on upstream and downstream industries in tourism, therefore, we need to develop the DAPP required by the merchants in advance and provide choice for them in the form of a template so as to truly achieve one-button deployment as well as quick application.

### 2.6 Password Recovery
We often hear that many people forget their own account name or password, which may cause them to fail to find the assets in the account. Such case often occurs to ordinary investors. For traditional banks, we can solve the issue by means of legal identification. However, there’s nothing that we can do in the blockchain world, which is obviously detrimental for ordinary investors to participate in.
Therefore, we consider using the relationship proof and assistance of our relatives or friends to retrieve the account or password (private key).
If the account or password is lost, the recovery procedure can be accessed when there is no activity within 30 days. A new public key shall be replaced by initiating Active Authority Modification of more than 3 people among relatives and friends in your Recovery Authority List, which will be executed after 7 days. Owner Authority Modification can be initiated after acquiring the Active Authority and the account can be retrieved after another 30 days.

### 2.7 Account Security
In the network of digital currency, it is very common for accounts to be stolen. The news about burglary of electronic wallets and exchanges always can be heard by people, which may restrict the enthusiasm of ordinary investors.
We will try to solve the issue of account security by means of multi-signature and relationship proof and more attention will be paid. 
We will force the Owner Authority of all the accounts to use multi-signature, which means there shall be at least 2 private keys or other accounts in the Owner Authority List. As a result, the danger caused by the reveal of single private key can be reduced. Cooperating with the delay of transfer, we can offer the possibility of time to help users retrieve their stolen accounts.
The Owner Authority is the highest authority of the account, which can directly change other authorities. We recommend users adding their relatives and friends to the Owner Authority List and adjusting the threshold to enable any activity of exercising the Owner Authority to require the Active Authority signatures by their relatives or friends (e.g. If the threshold value is 10, the weight value of the private key of the user is 8, and the weight value of five of relatives and friends of the users is 1 respectively, the user or his/her relatives and friends cannot take a unilateral action.). In this case, hackers have to steal the accounts of relatives and friends of the user. Even if the corresponding Active Authority is stolen, relatives and friends of the user can still use their own Owner Authority to modify the Active Authority.
The Owner Authority List can be modified by the Active Authority of the user but it requires the publicity of 30 days for execution, which can not only guarantee the account security but also delete the relatives and friends who are against the user or out of contact from the Owner Authority List.
In summary, the key of solving the issue of account security is to add the accounts of reliable relatives and friends to the Owner Authority List as well as grant suitable threshold and weight to them. The only situation that cannot be settled is that the hacker has stolen the private key of the Owner Authority and you have forgotten the private key of the Active Authority as well. Though the hacker is not able to steal anything, you cannot delete the stolen private key from the Owner Authority List and you can only transfer all of your assets to guarantee their security.

### 2.8 Minimize Resource Consumption
Current transaction confirmation of BTC and creation of new BTC for circulation require a great amount of computing power for constant operation. Such computing power is operated by miners through so-called mining rigs. BTC miners compete with each other to increase the next new transaction block for the whole BTC blockchain, which is completed by Hash Function. As a result, the miners launch a fierce arms race and a huge amount of power resources are wasted. 
The underlying architecture of CTG system applies the latest consensus algorithm of DPOS which is totally different from the mechanism of POW. There are many benefits, including no need of mining, no need of arms race, green environmental protection and energy efficiency.

### 2.9 Low Service Fee
The huge waste of computing power of BTC leads to low efficiency and the increase of the transaction cost. In the network of ETH, transaction, transfer, storage, operation, as well as development and deployment of smart contract require the consumption of gas cost. With the heat of crowd-funding of the ICO project, the increase of demands of ETH and the frequency of token transfer, the transaction cost will be added. The amount of transaction cost can be set manually and the merchant paying more money can be handled in priority, which will cause the transaction cost to be higher and higher as well as bring the injustice.
EOS is the mechanism based on rights and interests of owners. The amount of EOS tokens determines the corresponding proportion of network resources (such as transfer line, bandwidth, computing power, etc.) that can be enjoyed for free. Therefore, ETH can rent its network resources to the holders of ETH tokens while EOS can directly transfer the ownership of its network resources to the holder of EOS tokens.
In other words, if you own EOS tokens, you will acquire corresponding resources for free.
From the design and architecture of EOS, it is aimed at building a free, secure, easy-to-use, high-performance and well-compatible underlying system with public chains, which can meet the demands of commercial application. If these concepts are realized, a flood of projects and application development will be attracted and a new round of climax may be brought to the investment of blockchain. EOS is the most suitable choice of architecture for CTG so far.
