CTG Whitepaper V1.0
===================

Abstract
--------
The appearance of blockchain technology is an outstanding innovation, which can bring
great convenience to the cross-border currency exchange in particular. However, based
on the first generation of blockchain technology, the transaction confirmation speed of
Bitcoin (BTC) usually requires more than 10 minutes, and even dozens of minutes, which
is indeed too slow. Ethereum (ETH) is called the second generation of blockchain
technology and its added smart contract can make all kinds of applications expanded
freely in the network of blockchain. Nevertheless, the consensus algorithm of ETH
applies the POW mechanism of BTC which can optimize the transaction confirmation
speed. But it is still difficult to be put into practice.

As the renovation of the third generation of blockchain technology, EOS can shorten the
transaction confirmation speed to a second level, and even a millisecond level, which
makes cross-border payment and daily transaction easily come true. The new mechanism
of smart contract has solved the problem of network congestion of applications in ETH.
CTGâ€™s first global ecological application platform with public chains in tourism based on
the latest blockchain technology applies the renovation of the third generation of
blockchain technology as the basic structure. Our platform can be practically applied in
multiple currencies exchange of cross-border tourism industries and relevant daily
payment. The issue of multiple currencies exchange will be first settled. Then the
corresponding modifications will be done aimed at upstream and downstream industries
of tourism. For example, expansion of super nodes together with concurrency of
distributed nodes, increase of the application bandwidth based on tokens, introduction
of the authentication system for multiple identities, etc. We will also make various DAPP
application templates for upstream and downstream industries of tourism so as to
provide convenience to the quick application of any third-party merchant so that the
secondary development is not needed. Our system will become the platform of tourism
industry chain in a specific field, which can make all kinds of applications of third-party
merchants rapidly entered as well as introduce room booking, flight reservation,
transportation, travel agency and tourist guide locking, operation of scenic spots,
management of restaurant chains, food, groceries, television, transmission of media, and
other tourism-related industries.
